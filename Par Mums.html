    <p><h1> The C# guide provides many resources about the C# language. This site has many different audiences. Depending on your experience with programming, or with the C# language and .NET, you may wish to explore different sections of this guide.</h1>

<h2> For brand-new developers:</h2>

Start with the Quickstarts section. These quickstarts let you explore the C# language interactively in your browser. From there, you can move on to the tutorials section. These tutorials show you how to create C# programs from scratch. The tutorials provide a step-by-step process to create programs. They show the language concepts, and how to build C# programs on your own. If you prefer reading overview information first, try the tour of the C# language. It explains the concepts of the C# language. After reading this, you'll have a basic understanding of the language, and be ready to try the tutorials, or build something on your own.

<h2>For developers new to C#:</h2>	

If you've done development before, but are new to C#, read the tour of the C# language. It covers the basic syntax and structure for the language, and you can use the language tour to contrast C# with other languages you've used. You can also browse the tutorials to try basic C# programs.

<h2>Experienced C# developers:</h2>

If you've used C# before, you should start by reading what's in the latest version of the language. Check out What's new in C# for the new features in the current version.</p>

    <p><h1>About Java Usage Metrics</h1>
<h2>Your Privacy and Anonymity</h2>
During download, installation or automatic updates of the Java Runtime Environment (hereafter referred to as "Java"), Oracle does not collect or track any personally identifiable information (such as names or email addresses) about you, or associate your online behavior with personally identifiable data.

We do collect a limited set of information that is not personally identifiable. It is anonymous technical data commonly known as "telemetry." For an element-by-element description of what is collected and how it helps us, details are available.

<h2>We Collect this Data to Measure Our Own Performance, Diagnose Problems, and Improve Your Experience</h2>
The purpose of the telemetry transmitted to Oracle during the Java installation and auto-update process is to find any technical problems or anomalies that occur, so we can understand and correct them. It's similar to a car mechanic's practice of plugging into your engine's diagnostic port to identify performance issues (not to identify the car's owner!). The issues we identify could be anything from a missing file or compatibility with a new browser release to a server overload. But your privacy and anonymity are not compromised by our collecting this telemetry — but it's what helps to improve the experience to try to ensure that you will always have a successful experience.

<h2>For a more detailed explanation about Oracle's performance data collection, please click here.</h2>

If You Would Like to Disable the Collection of this Data
If you wish to disable the collection and transmission of the telemetry during your initial Java download and installation, please download the full 'offline installer' version, and make sure you are not connected to the Internet when you install it.

Once you download and install Java, the software's automatic update feature will continue to send telemetry to Oracle with each subsequent automatic update. However, you can disable automatic updates by following the directions on the FAQ.</p>
