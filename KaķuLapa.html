<h1>Facts About Cats</h1>
<ul>
<li> To their owners, cats will always be fascinating creatures. So here are a few facts about cats you may find interesting.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The cat</h2>
<ul>
<li>Cats have been domesticated for around 4,000 years. While they were once valued for their hunting abilities, they are now valued for their companionship and loving behaviour.</li>
<li>While not well known, the collective nouns used for cats and kittens are a clowder of cats and a kindle of kittens.</li>
<li>Our domestic cats are known as little cats. They differ from large cats such as lions and tigers because they are naturally active at night and can purr.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The feline body & behaviour</h2>

<ul>With 48 recognised <u>cat breeds</u> and <u>pedigrees</u> in Australia plus an endless combination of cross breeds it's amazing just how different each cat can look and behave. But there are many amazing physical characteristics that all cats possess, read on for more fascinating facts about your feline friend.</ul>
<ul>
<li>Cats have 30 teeth (dogs have 42) and most of us know how sharp they are!</li>
<li>Cats have a reflective layer in their eyes, known as the tapetum lucidum, which magnifies incoming light allowing them to see up to 6 times better than humans can in low light. Cats (as well as dogs) also have a ‘third eyelid’ called the nictitating membrane which is found on the inside corner of the eye which is an extra protective function of the eye.</li>
<li>Cats have 32 muscles in their ears (humans have only 12). This gives the ear mobility, enabling it to precisely locate prey such as mice or the opening of their cat food! Cats can also hear frequencies that are both below and above those that can be heard by humans. The ear also has the job of helping to maintain balance and the ability to right themselves when falling – which is where the phrase “Cats always land on their feet” came from.</li>
<li>More cats are left-pawed than right.</li>
<li>The texture of cat food is more important to cats than taste and cats can often be quite fussy about the smells of food. If your cat have ever licked you, you might compare the feel of their tongue to that of coarse sandpaper – that’s because a cats' tongue is covered in tiny backwards facing thorn like barbs that guide food to the back of the mouth. These rough tongues are also perfectly designed for grooming and lapping up water.</li>
</ul>
